/**
 * Enumeration of acceptable navigation requests.<br><br>
 * 
 * <strong>Filename:</strong> SeqNavRequests.java<br><br>
 * 
 * <strong>Description:</strong><br>
 * The <code>ADLSequencer</code> will accept the navigation requests defined
 * in by this class.  Requests correspond to the IMS SS Specification section
 * Navagation Behavior (NB) section.<br><br>
 * 
 * Navigation requests are signaled to the sequencer through the <code>
 * ADLNavigation</code> interface.<br><br>
 * 
 * <strong>Design Issues:</strong><br>
 * This implementation is intended to be used by the SCORM Sample RTE 1.3.<br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * <strong>Implementation Issues:</strong><br>
 * This enumeration does not include the 'choice' navigation request.  Because 
 * the 'choice' navigation request requires a parameter indicating the target
 * activity, 'choice' navigation requests are triggered through an independent
 * method on the <code>ADLNavigation</code> interface.
 * 
 * <strong>Known Problems:</strong><br><br>
 * 
 * <strong>Side Effects:<strong><br><br>
 * 
 * <strong>References:</strong><br>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>IMS SS 1.0
 *     <li>SCORM 2004
 * </ul>
